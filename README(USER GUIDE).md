Hello, this is the user guide for the ToDoList program. We are very happy you decided to download the program.
To explain the program's function to an uninformed individual, you as the user can add items to a list (as long as they have a sub-256 character description to go along with them). This can be done by filling out the data fields of description and item name and then clikcing add item.
Once you add an item and its respective description, you have the option of defining the due date of the said item through the dazzling gregorian calendar pop-up as well as the status of the item (complete/incomplete). This can be selected by clicking on the data field.
If you encounter any errors or typos in inputting this valuable data, worry not as there is a reset button which resets all the fields on the left to make sure you get everything right as you so desire.
Clicking the add button is the final step to you progressing your journey towards task accountability, as it adds the item you hand-defined to the list of items which will be displayed.
The "delete item" and "clear all items" buttons allow you, the user, the have the freedom to change what is included within the list. For a gentler editing ability, just double click the fields edit the data within them to alter your list to your heart's content.
To make your list portable and more permanent, you can utilize the save and load buttons to store your to-do-list to a text file, which you can define through the load process within our program. The current list would be saved or loaded from local storage on your device.
If you need to search through the program, use the search bar located at the top of the window to narrow between Complete and Pending items in the list. Also, the headers act like sort buttons as well, clicking on them orders the information under them in decending or ascending order, the choice is yours!
Overall, we hope this program is very simple and straightforward in addressing your task management needs. Please share with your friends and family :D.
